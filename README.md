# 📊 Operation and Metric Analysis Using SQL

This project consists of two parts — analyzing job processing performance and understanding user engagement metrics for a platform — using SQL. It showcases end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `metric project.sql`: Contains all SQL queries for both datasets — job logs and user engagement metrics.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

### A) Job Review Metrics (job_interviews database)
- Analyzed job processing logs using date formatting and performance metrics.
- Extracted:
  - Average jobs processed per second/hour.
  - Top actors by number of jobs.
  - Duplicate job or actor IDs.
  - Language distribution among jobs.
  - 7-day rolling average throughput.

### B) User Engagement Metrics (metric database)
- Analyzed signup behavior and email event patterns.
- Extracted:
  - Weekly active users (WAU).
  - Weekly new signups.
  - Weeks taken for new users to engage.
  - Device usage analysis.
  - Email open/click/conversion rates.
